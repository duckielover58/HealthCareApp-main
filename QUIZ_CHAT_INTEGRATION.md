# Quiz to Chat Integration

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the quiz-to-chat redirection feature that passes quiz context to the AI chatbot for personalized health guidance.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Quiz Completion Redirect
- When users complete the health assessment quiz, they are automatically redirected to the chat page
- Quiz answers are passed as URL parameters to maintain context
- No more alert popup - seamless transition to AI assistant

### 2. Context-Aware AI Responses
- The AI chatbot receives quiz answers as context
- Initial response is automatically generated based on quiz results
- All subsequent chat interactions include quiz context for better personalization

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Quiz results are displayed prominently at the top of the chat page
- Loading states with spinner animation during AI response generation
- Age-appropriate language and safety considerations for children and teens

## Technical Implementation

### Quiz Page (`app/quiz/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// On quiz completion, redirect with context
const quizContext = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(newAnswers))
window.location.href = `/chat?quiz=${quizContext}`
```

### Chat Page (`app/chat/page.tsx`)
- Uses `useSearchParams` to extract quiz context from URL
- `useEffect` hook processes quiz context on page load
- `generateInitialResponse` creates personalized AI response
- All chat interactions include quiz context for better responses

### AI Service (`lib/client-api.ts`)
- Enhanced with age-appropriate language for children and teens
- Emphasizes telling adults about serious symptoms
- Uses simple, clear language appropriate for ages 8-15
